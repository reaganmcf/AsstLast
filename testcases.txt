Testcase is as follows

NOTE: ./WTFtest closes the server and 

First case:
1. ./WTFserver <port that is open>
2. destroy project (incase WTFtest is being run back to back being run back to back)
3. create project
4. mkdir project/folder/ && touch project/folder/file1 && echo some string of text > project/folder/file1
5. add project folder/file1
6. commit
7. push
8. touch ./project/file2 && add project file2 (empty file)
9. commit
10. push
11. echo more text again > file3 
12. cp ./project/.Manifest ./ (copy the manifest, so we can test update/upgrade later)
13. add project file3
14. commit 
15. push
16. mv ./.Manifest ./project/.Manifest (overwrite manifest with old version)
17. update
18. upgrade
19. rollback 3
